Mark,
1) Here is the added (and in several places corrected) code for  MAX2871_Command_7.bas .
   It compiles and works perfectly with MAX2871_Load_Word_115200_4.ino in all modes as
   fully verified on the bench, including:
		a) Mux Control (new feature, tested)
		b) Fractional Modulus Mode
		c) Reference Frequency adjustment
		d) Swept or Fixed Mode. Watching Project #3 sweep with only 1millisec delay is cool.
		e) Step Delay adjustable in milliseconds
		f) Port selection 0,1,2,etc
		g) Verbose mode option
		h) Arduino Message (if there is one, if not it says so)
		i) Automatic Screen size adjustment for small (like Dell Mini) or large (like 14" and up).
			This fixed an annoying size problem with small screens.  It can be improved further.
