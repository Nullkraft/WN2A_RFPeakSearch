REGISTER INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE
At initial power-up, after the correct application of voltages to
the supply pins, the ADF4356 registers must be programmed in
sequence. For f ≤ 75 MHz, use the following sequence:
 1. Register 13
 2. Register 12
 3. Register 11
 4. Register 10
 5. Register 9
 6. Register 8.
 7. Register 7
 8. Register 6
 9. Register 5
10. Register 4
11. Register 3
12. Register 2
13. Register 1
14. Ensure that >16 ADC_CLK cycles have elapsed between the write of Register 10 and Register 0.
    For example, if ADC_CLK = 99.417 kHz, wait 16/99,417 sec = 161 μs. See Reg10 section for more.
15. Register 0




For f PFD > 75 MHz (initially lock with halved f PFD), use the following sequence:

 1. Register 13 (for halved fPFD)
 2. Register 12
 3. Register 11
 4. Register 10
 5. Register 4 (with the R divider doubled to halve fPFD).
 6. Register 9.
 7. Register 8.
 8. Register 7.
 9. Register 6 (for the desired f PFD).
10. Register 5.
11. Register 4 (with the R divider doubled to halve fPFD).
12. Register 3.
13. Register 2 (for halved fPFD).
14. Register 1 (for halved fPFD).
15. Ensure that >16 ADC_CLK cycles have elapsed between the write of Register 10 and Register 0.
    For example, if ADC_CLK = 99.417 kHz, wait 16/99,417 sec = 161 μs. See Reg10 section for more.
16. Register 0 (for halved fPFD; autocalibration enabled).
17. Register 13 (for the desired fPFD).
18. Register 4 (with the R divider set for the desired fPFD).
19. Register 2 (for the desired f PFD).
20. Register 1 (for the desired f PFD).
21. Register 0 (for the desired f PFD; autocalibration disabled).




FREQUENCY UPDATE SEQUENCE
Frequency updates require updating the auxiliary modulator (MOD2) in Register 2, the fractional
value (FRAC1) in Register 1, and the integer value (INT) in Register 0. It is recommended to
perform a temperature dependent VTUNE calibration by updating Register 10 first. Therefore, for
fPFD ≤ 75 MHz, the sequence must be as follows:
 1. Register 13
 2. Register 10
 3. Register 2
 4. Register 1
 5. Ensure that >16 ADC_CLK cycles have elapsed between the write of Register 10 and Register 0.
    For example, if ADC_CLK = 99.417 kHz, wait 16/99,417 sec = 161 μs. See Reg10 section for more.
 6. Register 0


For fPFD > 75 MHz (initially lock with halved fPFD), the sequence must be as follows:
 1. Register 13 (for halved fPFD).
 2. Register 10.
 3. Register 4 (With the R divider doubled to halved f PFD).
 4. Register 2 (for halved f PFD).
 5. Register 1 (for halved f PFD).
 6. Ensure that >16 ADC_CLK cycles have elapsed between the write of Register 10 and Register 0.
   For example, if ADC_CLK = 99.417 kHz, wait 16/99,417 sec = 161 μs. See Reg10 section for more.
 7. Register 0 (for halved f PFD; autocalibration enabled).
 8. Register 13 (for the desired fPFD).
 9. Register 4 (With the R divider set for the desired fPFD).
10. Register 2 (for the desired fPFD).
11. Register 1 (for the desired fPFD).
12. Register 0 (for desired fPFD; autocalibration disabled).

The frequency change occurs on the write to Register 0.
